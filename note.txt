this project is about Laravel GraphQL
to use GraphQL in laravel we need lighthouse

install lighthouse = composer require nuwave/lighthouse
then to use it in laravel we need playground ( can think of it as postman)

composer require mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground

php artisan lighthouse:query Greetings

to reach GraphQl playground add this ( /graphql-playground ) in the end of domain


# Write your query or mutation here
#{
 # greetings
#}
#single user
#{
#user(id: 2) {
#    id
#    name
#    email
#  }
#}
# ailases to fetch multiple user
#{
 #userOne: user(id: 2) {
  #  id
   # name
   # email
  #}

# userTwo: user(id: 4) {
 #   id
 #   name
  #  email
 # }
#}
#paginate
{
  users (first:5 , page :1){
    data{
      id
      name
    }
    paginatorInfo{
      currentPage
      lastPage
