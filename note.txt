this project is about Laravel GraphQL
to use GraphQL in laravel we need lighthouse
install lighthouse = composer require nuwave/lighthouse
then to use it in laravel we need playground ( can think of it as postman)
composer require mll-lab/laravel-graphql-playground


 php artisan lighthouse:query Greetings
